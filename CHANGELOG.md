## Changelog

All notable changes will be docmented here.

## 1.4.0

* Reorganized questions so the app can now offer suggestions for later answers
* App now asks if you want a VueJS frontend without assuming you do. How polite!
* Database questions now don't kill the app when you enter invalid credentials. It just asks again
